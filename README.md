# MinecraftSkinTotem

Makes Minecraft Totem of Undying textures that look like player skins

###### Usage:
```
python3 totem.py Username
```

The script will generate both a larger preview image in the root directory as well as a resource pack folder that can be dragged into your resourcepacks directory. (Only works in 1.13/1.14)

Since this is a general program that does the same thing to every skin, it works better on some skins than others.  Most regular skins will work fine, but if your skin is a specific pattern (checkerboard, rainbow, etc) then it might be a better idea to make the totem texture yourself, since this script will distort the way it looks.
